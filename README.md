Flutter Engineer Translation Test

## Getting Started

The purpose of this test is to see how well the candidate can translate designs to actual working mobile applications. 
Half of the time, client-facing engineers (web and mobile developers) will be translating designs from say a Figma design project to code. 
We want to be sure that candidates can accurately translate a design task given to a very high standard.
